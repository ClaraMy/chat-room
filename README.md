# Pomodoro study room
*by Clara Many*

Interested in working methods, organization and productivity, I decided to create this chat to help people focus on the tasks they have to do.

It's based on a working method called “Pomodoro”. This method consists of working for 25 minutes, then taking a 5-minute break. After four work cycles, you can take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes. The aim is to maintain concentration and improve productivity.

Joining this chat allows people to motivate each other, help each other and chat during breaks. 

Join now!
